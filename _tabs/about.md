# Objective and Vision

## Objective:
Our mission is to simplify the learning and understanding of AI by breaking it down into essential building blocks. These building blocks are designed to be easily comprehensible and can be seamlessly combined to construct innovative AI solutions.

## Vision:
At bubl-ai, we envision a collaborative space where individuals passionate about AI come together to contribute solutions. Inspired by the collaborative spirit of open-source coding, our platform is dedicated to facilitating collective creation. Just as multiple minds collaborate on code, we encourage a diverse community to collaborate and build something impactful in the realm of AI.

## Symbolism in Our Logo:
The logo encapsulates the essence of AI through its four pillars: mathematics, software development, hardware, and infrastructure. Each pillar represents unique challenges and opportunities, which we believe can be addressed through the integration of building blocks. These building blocks form the foundation of knowledge, enabling the development of efficient and composable solutions.

- Blue symbolizes logic and stability, reflecting the precision found in mathematical concepts. White represents clarity and purity, embodying the clear understanding essential in mathematical principles.

- Green, a versatile shade, embodies growth, adaptability, and balance. Reflecting the continuous evolution and creativity required in the dynamic field of software development.

- Metallic tones such as silver or gray signify modernity, durability, and technological sophistication. These characteristics align with the traits often associated with computer hardware.

- Earthy tones like brown signify stability, reliability, and a grounded foundation. Reflecting the essential and solid nature of infrastructure.
