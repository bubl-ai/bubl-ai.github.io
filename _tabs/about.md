## Objective

Hello there! At Bubl-AI, our mission is to simplify the learning, understanding, and implementation of AI by breaking it down into building blocks, which we call "bubls". Imagine it as a collection of experiences and tools that are similar to LEGO pieces for creating AI solutions!

- **Green**: Represents growth, adaptability, and balance, reflecting the continuous evolution and creativity required in the dynamic field of software development.

- **Metallic shades**: Signify tech innovations, representing modernity, durability, and technological sophistication.
